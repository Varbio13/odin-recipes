        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A very simple to make chocolate cake that I developed while trying to combine my chocolate and coffee cravings.</p>


        <p>It tastes so good no one will believe how easy it was! (It can be frosted with chocolate or coffee icing but I like it plain.)</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1<sup>1</sup><sub>16</sub>cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>cup butter</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup cold, strong, brewed coffee</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 
                an 8-inch pan. Sift together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt.
                 Set aside.</li>

            <li>In a medium bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
                Add egg and vanilla and beat well. Add flour mixture, alternating with
                coffee. Beat until just incorporated.</li>

            <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes, or
                until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Allow
                to cool before frosting.</li>
            
            
        </ol>
